\begin{homeworkProblem}

    The Paradise City Police Department employs 30 police officers. Each officer 
    works 5 days per week. The crime rate fluctuates with the day of the week, 
    so the minimum number of police officers required each day depends on which 
    day of the week it is: Saturday, 24; Sunday, 13; Monday, 15; Tuesday, 25; 
    Wednesday, 26; Thursday, 18; Friday, 22. The police department wants to 
    schedule police officers to minimize the number of officers whose days off 
    are not consecutive.
    \\ \\
    Formulate this problem as an optimization problem (hint: define the variable 
    $x_{ij}$, where $i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 7\}$ and $i\neq j$, to be the number 
    of officers who are scheduled to not work on days $i$ and $j$).
    \\

    \begin{solution}
        \[
            \begin{array}{rl}
                \min\limits_{\boldsymbol{x}} & \underset{f_0(\boldsymbol{x})}{\boxed{-x_{12} - x_{23} - x_{34} - x_{45} - x_{56} - x_{67} - x_{71}}}, \\ [3ex]
                \text{s.t.} &  - 6 + \sum_{j=2}^{7} x_{1j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & -17 + \sum_{j=1, j \neq 2}^{7} x_{2j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & - 15 + \sum_{j=1, j \neq 3}^{7} x_{3j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & -5 + \sum_{j=1, j \neq 4}^{7} x_{4j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & -4 + \sum_{j=1, j \neq 5}^{7} x_{5j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & -12 + \sum_{j=1, j \neq 6}^{7} x_{6j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & -8 + \sum_{j=1, j \neq 7}^{7} x_{7j} \leq 0, \\ [3ex]
                            & x_{ij} - 30 \leq 0, \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 7\}, i \neq j \\ [3ex]
                            & - x_{ij} \leq 0 \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 7\}, i \neq j

            \end{array}
        \]
        where
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $x_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}$ is the number of officers who are scheduled to not work on days \(i\) and \(j\),
            where $i, j \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, 7 \}$ and $i \neq j$;
            \item $f_0$ : $\mathbb{R}^7 \to \mathbb{R}$ is the \textit{objective function}, 
            or the number of officers whose days off are not consecutive;
            \item The first seven constraints represent the minimum number of officers required each day of the week,
            where day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, day 3 is Tuesday, day 4 is Wednesday, day 5 is Thursday, day 6 is 
            Friday, and day 7 is Saturday;
            \item The eighth constraint prevents the number of officers scheduled to not work on any days $i$ and $j$
            from exceeding 30 (the total number of officers employed);
            \item The ninth constraint prevents the number of officers scheduled to not work on any days $i$ and $j$
            from going negative;
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{solution}
