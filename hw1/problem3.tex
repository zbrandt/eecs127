\begin{homeworkProblem}
    
    A taxi company has $n$ taxis available and $n$ customers to be picked up as 
    soon as possible. For every $i, j \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$, if taxi $i$ decides 
    to pick up customer $j$, the amount of time (delay) to pick up the customer 
    is $d_{ij}$. Each taxi is allowed to pick up only one customer. The goal is 
    to assign each customer to a taxi so that the total delay (i.e., sum of the 
    delays for all customers) is minimized.
    \\ \\
    Formulate this assignment problem as an optimization problem.
    \\

    \begin{solution}
        \[
            \begin{array}{rl}
            \min\limits_{x_{ij}} & \underset{f_0(x_{ij})}{\boxed{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} d_{ij} x_{ij}}}, \\ [3ex]
            \text{s.t.} & \underset{f_1(x_{ij})}{\boxed{-1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij} \leq 0 \quad \forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\}}}, \\ [3ex]
                        % & \underset{f_2(x_{ij})}{\boxed{-1 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} \leq 0 \quad \forall j \in \{1, \dots, n\}}}
            \end{array}
        \]
        where
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}\) is a binary variable, where \(x_{ij} = 1\) if taxi \(i\) is assigned to customer \(j\) and \(x_{ij} = 0\) otherwise;
            \item $f_0$ : the \textit{objective function}, or \textit{total delay} for all customers;
            \item $f_1$ : the \textit{taxi assignment constraint}, each taxi can only pick up one customer;
            % \item $f_2$ : the \textit{customer assignment constraint}, each customer must be picked up by exactly one taxi;
        \end{itemize}

    \end{solution}
