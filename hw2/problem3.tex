\section*{Problem 3}
A company has $n$ factories. Factory $i$ (for $i=1,2,...,n$) is located at point $(a_i,b_i)$ in the two-dimensional plane $\mathbb R^2$. The company wants to locate a warehouse at a point $(x_1,x_2)$ that minimizes 
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\sum_{i=1}^n (\text{distance from factory } i \text{ to the warehouse})^2
\end{equation}
Find all possible values of the point  $(x_1^*,x_2^*)$ that satisfy the necessary condition for local optimality.
