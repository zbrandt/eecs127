\begin{homeworkProblem}

    \textbf{(Coding)} Consider a picture of the Berkeley logo named 
    Berkeley1.png that you can download from bCourses $\rightarrow$ Files 
    $\rightarrow$ HW.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [i)] Convert the image to a grayscale image, and store its data 
        into a matrix $A$.
        \item [ii)] Plot the singular values of $A$. To do so, draw the point 
        $(k,\sigma_k)$ in $\mathbb R^2$ for $k=1,...,\min(m,n)$, where $m$ and 
        $n$ denote the dimensions of $A$ and $\sigma_k$ is the $k^{\text{th}}$ 
        largest singular value of $A$.
        \item [iii)] Consider the optimization problem
        \begin{equation}
            \min_{B\in\mathbb R^{m\times n}}\|A-B\|_F,\qquad \text{s.t.}\qquad 
            \text{rank}(B)\leq k
        \end{equation}
        and consider the error $e_k=\frac{\|A-B^*\|_F^2}{\|A\|_F^2}$, where 
        $B^*$ is an optimal solution. Solve the above optimization problem in 
        three scenarios of $k=30$, $k=80$ and $k=100$. For each case, report 
        the error $e_k$ and the percentage $\frac{k}{\min(m,n)}\times 100$ 
        (which shows what percentage of the singular values of $A$ is used), 
        and also draw the grayscale image corresponding to $B^*$ (note: you do 
        not need to report the matrix $B^*$ in your homework submission and 
        only the image together with the code is enough).

        \item [iv)] Redo Parts (i), (ii), and (iii) for the Berkeley campus 
        picture Berkeley2.png that you can download from bCourses 
        $\rightarrow$ Files $\rightarrow$ HW.
    \end{itemize}
