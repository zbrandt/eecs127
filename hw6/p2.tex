\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Consider the optimization problem: 
    \begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
            &\min_{x\in\mathbb R^3}\  \
            \quad e^{-x_1-x_2-x_3}+(x_1+2x_2+3x_3)^4 \\
            &\text{ s.t.}\qquad x_1-x_2-x_3=1 \\
            &\qquad\quad \ \  x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_1x_2+x_2x_3+x_1x_3\leq 2\\
            &\qquad\quad \ \  0\leq  x_1\leq 1 \\
            &\qquad\quad \ \   0\leq  x_2\leq 1  \\
            &\qquad\quad \ \   0\leq  x_3\leq 1  
        \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [i)] Prove that $x=[1 \  \ 0 \  \ 0]^T$ is a feasible
        point.

        \item [ii)] Using the Weierstrass theorem, prove that the above
        optimization problem has a solution.

        \item [iii)] Prove that every local minimum of the above
        optimization problem is a global minimum.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [i)] For the point $x=[1 \  \ 0 \  \ 0]^T$ is a feasible 
                point, it needs to satisfy all the constraints of the 
                optimization problem. For the equality constraint:
                \[
                    \begin{split}
                        x_1 - x_2 - x_3 - 1 = 0 \\
                        1 - 0 - 0 - 1 = 0
                    \end{split}
                \]
                This holds true. For the inequality constraint:
                \[
                    \begin{split}
                        x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_1x_3 - 2 \leq 0 \\
                        1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 2 = -1 \leq 0
                    \end{split}
                \]
                This also holds true. Finally, for the bound constraints:
                \[
                    \begin{split}
                        0 \leq x_1 \leq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 \leq 1 \leq 1 \\
                        0 \leq x_2 \leq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 \leq 0 \leq 1 \\
                        0 \leq x_3 \leq 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 \leq 0 \leq 1
                    \end{split}
                \]
                All bound constraints hold true as well. Therefore, the point
                $x=[1 \  \ 0 \  \ 0]^T$ is a feasible point.

            \item [ii)] The Weierstrass theorem states that a continuous
                function defined on a compact set attains its minimum and
                maximum values. In this optimization problem, the objective
                function is continuous, as it is composed of exponential and
                polynomial functions, which are both continuous. The feasible
                set defined by the constraints is closed and bounded, making it
                compact. Therefore, by the Weierstrass theorem, the optimization
                problem has a solution.

            \item [iii)] If the optimization problem is convex, then every
                local minimum is a global minimum. The objective function must
                be convex, the functions defining the inequality constraints
                must be convex, and the functions defining the equality 
                contraints must be affine. The objective function is the sum of
                the exponential function $e^{-x_1-x_2-x_3}$, which is convex, 
                and the polynomial function $(x_1+2x_2+3x_3)^4$, which is also 
                convex. The function defining the inequality constraint is
                $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_1x_2+x_2x_3+x_1x_3$, which is 
                convex. The function defining the equality constraint is
                $x_1-x_2-x_3-1$, which is affine. Therefore, the optimization
                problem is convex, and every local minimum is a global minimum.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}
