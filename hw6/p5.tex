\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Consider the optimization problem 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            &\min_{x\in\mathbb R^2} \quad \alpha x_1+\beta x_2\\
            &\ \ \text{s.t.} \quad  x_1\geq 0\\
            &\hspace{0.95cm} x_2\geq 0\\
            &\hspace{0.95cm} x_1+4x_2\leq 4\\
            &\hspace{0.95cm} 4x_1+x_2\leq 4
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two constants. Run the following experiment 
    200 times:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generate a random  pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ where $\alpha$ and 
            $\beta$ are chosen uniformly from the interval $[-1,1]$.
        \item Solve the resulting LP in CVX and record the obtained optimal 
            solution $x^*$.
    \end{itemize}
    
    By checking how many different solutions you have obtained in these 200 
    experiments and how many times each solution has appeared, empirically 
    find the vertices of the feasible set and for each obtained vertex 
    calculate the probability that the vertex is a solution when 
    $(\alpha,\beta)$ is random. \\
    
    \begin{solution}

        The vertices of the feasible set are 
        \[
            (0,0), \quad (0,1), \quad (1,0), \quad \left(\frac{4}{5},
            \frac{4}{5}\right)
        \]
        After one instance of running the experiment 200 times, the 
        following probabilities were observed for each vertex being 
        the optimal solution:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $(0,0)$: 0.310
            \item $(0,1)$: 0.235
            \item $(1,0)$: 0.185
            \item $\left(\frac{4}{5},\frac{4}{5}\right)$: 0.270
        \end{itemize}
    
    \end{solution}
