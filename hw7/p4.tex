\begin{homeworkProblem}
	A company supplies goods to three customers, each requiring 30 units,
	i.e., $d_1=d_2=d_3=30$. The company has two warehouses. Warehouse 1 has
	$s_1=40$ units and warehouse 2 has $s_2=30$ units. The costs of shipping
	1 unit from warehouse 1 to customers 1, 2, and 3 are \$20, \$25, and
	\$20, respectively. The costs of shipping 1 unit from warehouse 2 to
	customers 1, 2, and 3 are \$10, \$30, and \$40, respectively.

	There is a penalty for each unmet unit of demand: the penalties for
	customers 1, 2, and 3 are \$90, \$80, and \$70, respectively. Since
	$s_1+s_2<d_1+d_2+d_3$, define a fictitious warehouse 3 with supply $s_3$
	that models the shortage so that $s_1+s_2+s_3\ge d_1+d_2+d_3$. The goal is
	to minimize the sum of penalties and shipping costs.
